On the 2nd week, I was able to figure out why my page wasn't updating as well. It was because I didn't click "auto-save" which the progress of my stuff wasn't updated and because of that, I had to redo everything. I never realized this, and this delayed a lot of time between the notebook checks and delayed me by a lot of time. Me and Matthew are now a bit behind, is what they said when we did a live review on Monday. But I think we're gonna be able to catch up easily on the 3rd week, since things are starting to slow down.
