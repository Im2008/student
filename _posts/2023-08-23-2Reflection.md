During the 1st week was pretty difficult for me, but I was able to figure it out by Wednesday with Matthew to be able to set up a fully functional site made with Python, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Although I still have some files that I didn't publish in my vscode, I have some idea into how i'm able to do it and may be able to establish it into something better from my imagination. However, the site didn't publish anything and I wasn't able to figure out why. For the next week, i'll find a way to figure out that issue.
