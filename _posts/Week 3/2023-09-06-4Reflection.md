On the 3rd week, we were able to catch up a bit. We were able to help pollish our snake game, and Matthew was able to create a game of life simulation. I was able to create a tic tac toe game before the end of the week and made my site more pollished. I still realized that the progress needs to go in the CSSE homepage, and i'll figure that out eventually on Monday. Otherwise I look forward to the next week of catching up to the live reviews.
