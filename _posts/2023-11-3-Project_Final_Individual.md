<h2><b> FINAL REFLECTION: </b></h2>

<p>For our project, we made a game that is similar to mario, but the themeing is different along with its character.</p>

<p>My contribution in regards to this project was generally making a base website for Gavin, and Matthew to start off with. I made the "intended" mechanic which was the questions 1-7, the general base of the menu, added more sprites, added tutorials and outlines for the game, and fixed some bugs in regards towards .ipynb files and .md files not corresponding with each other. </p>

        <li> The questions that were gonna be added to the game couldn't make it in because of how difficult it would be to implement and was mostly someone that was on the side for later just incase there was some time for Gavin and the others to add it in. They had code that the person had to review and understand such as: HTML, CSS, a bit of PYTHON, and JAVASCRIPT. THe player would then click a button and it would innitially send them to the next level, but since we only had 2 levels, I decided to have 3-4 questions per level instead.</li><br>
        <li>The general base of the menu was made first with HTML and CSS, where I tried to design the homepage to where the user could navigate without having to click to blogs in order to find the homepage. Matthew fixed this issue and made the menu more easier to access, so I instead worked on the Tutorial and the general concept of the game.</li><br>
        <li>The Tutorial I was able to do pretty quickly in only a day. Because of my experience from making the questions, I was able to make a good looking, yet functional tutorial that the user could easily access from the menu, or blogs if they really wanted to look there as well. The Tutorial was meant to show the controls of the game, "wasd" controls along with jumping "W" or "space" keys, and provided the general goal just incase the reader wanted to read it.</li><br>
        <li>The bugs with .ipynb and .md files was a mistake on my end, as I kept deleting the md file that was linked to the ipynb file which cause a lot of the commits to keep breaking. Instead I just chose to commit stuff instead of trying to delete duplicate files and it began to work just fine.</li>
