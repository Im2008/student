On Week 5, I started to focus more towards finishing the test so I could help Matthew out for later. Matthew was absent for 4 days because of a cold, so I wanted to help him catch up for later, and eventually be able to focus more on the dog animation rather than only the test. I haven't changed the animation as much, and mostly just kept it as is, so it wasn't anything new for this week.
