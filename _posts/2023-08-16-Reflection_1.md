During the 0th week, it feels like a class that was pretty normal. Since I took animation 1-2, I had a lot of confidence in this class and still do, in which I used this confidence to help set up my kasm page. Although I did have some struggles, and had to stay after lunch to fix it, I was able to catch up slowly but surely.
