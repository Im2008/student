<div class="top-right">Hello, my name is Ian Manangan, and I'm excited to be a part of Computer Science & Software Engineering! I’m currently a Sophomore at Del Norte High School and during my free time, I typically like to play volleyball. Finishing 8th grade, I played for a local program called Seaside, and continued to play there to this day, along with the Del Norte Volleyball “B Team” in Freshman year. I usually play as an outside, or someone who plays on the outside positions, but I’ve played other positions as well such as the Setter, Opposite, and Libero </div>

<div class="top-middle">The main reason for taking CSSE was because I wanted to get some experience with JavaScript and Python so I can use that for unity or my animations in the future. Similar to Matthew, I've taken Computer Animation 1 and 2 during my Freshman year and initially was gonna make Animation as my primary goal. However, I needed some experience with coding as a suggestion from my Sister who’s a Computer Science major.</div>
